The android application consists of three modules:

1) Controlling servomotor movements ( Clock/Anti-clock)  via button press from an adroid app.

2) Controlling servomotor movements ( Clock/Anti-clock) using Android's built-in Orientation sensor readings(in Degree radian for both X/Y plane).

3) Selecting a 2D image of your practical maze design and the AI algorithm will solve the maze, Generate a path, Convert path into real life instructions ( Left = 1, Right = 3 , Forward =2 , Backward =4 ) 
   and then use these instructions to create steps which moves Servomotors and solve the maze itself.
